# Flamboyant

A note-taking app inspired by Apple's official note app.  

I mainly built this to dip my toes into Realm but also delved a bit into custom table view cells, writing Controller files, and building a database manager that would allow for Realm to be swapped out with other data persistence methods!  Cool right?

Flamboyant was made with Realm, irony (peep the screenshots :) and love.
